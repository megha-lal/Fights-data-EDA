# Fights-data-EDA
This is a code for some exploratory data analysis on the flight data. Just starting to play around with a bit of python coding useful for data analysis.

Some insights drawn are:
1. Top 5 frequent destinations
2. Top 5 flights with longest air times
3. Top 5 flights with longest departure delays
4. Top 5 flights with longest arrival delays

Some graphs are plotted for:
1. Flight statistics from different airports
2. Average departure delay from various airpors
3. Average arrival delay at various airports
4. Flight carrier frequency
5. On-time arrival percentage analysis

Some dataframe manipulation steps are performed to calculate mean ans standard deviation of flight delays to understand whether DELTA flights or UNITED flights are more delayed.
